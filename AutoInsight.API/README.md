# AutoInsight VIN Decoder API

AutoInsight VIN Decoder API is a RESTful web service that allows developers to decode Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) and obtain detailed vehicle information along with a mock price estimate. It uses the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) public API as its backend data source.

## Features

- Decode standard 17-character VINs to extract detailed vehicle info:
  - Make, Model, Year, Manufacturer
  - Engine details, Fuel types, Transmission, Drive type, and more
- Get a mock price estimate based on make, model, and year
- Consistent error handling with informative error codes and messages
- Fully documented with Swagger/OpenAPI
- CORS enabled for easy integration in client apps

## Base URL

```

[https://your-api-host-url/](https://your-api-host-url/)

```

## Endpoints

### Decode VIN

```

GET /api/v1/vehicles/decode-vin/{vin}

```

- **Parameters:**
  - `vin` (string): 17-character vehicle VIN to decode
- **Response:** `VinDecodeResponse` object with detailed vehicle data or error info

### Get Price Estimate

```

GET /api/v1/vehicles/pricing?make={make}\&model={model}\&year={year}

```

- **Query Parameters:**
  - `make` (string): Vehicle make (e.g., "Toyota")
  - `model` (string): Vehicle model (e.g., "Camry")
  - `year` (int): Vehicle year (e.g., 2020)
- **Response:** `PriceEstimateResponse` with a mock estimated price

### Health Check

```

GET /health

```

- **Response:** Returns `Healthy` if API is running

### Root Metadata

```

GET /

````

- **Response:** API name, version, status, and documentation link

## Error Handling

Errors return a standardized `ApiErrorResponse` object with fields:

- `Code`: Machine-readable error code
- `Message`: Human-readable error message
- `Details`: Optional validation details

Example:

```json
{
  "code": "INVALID_VIN_FORMAT",
  "message": "VIN must be exactly 17 characters long for standard decoding."
}
````

## Deployment

This API can be deployed easily to cloud services supporting ASP.NET Core, such as:

* Render.com
* Railway.app
* Azure App Service

## Usage Notes

* VIN validation excludes characters I, O, Q to prevent confusion.
* The price estimate is a mock and does not reflect real market values.
